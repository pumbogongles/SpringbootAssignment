# SpringbootAssignment

●  	What did you like about this project?
It was very tough. Googling for certain concepts and solutions allowed me to use querySelector to manipulate the HTML file through javascript with the setAttribute()
It was nice to know that by containing certain older concepts, i was able to make the date display without older dates.

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?
The initial stages of setting everything up was very tough. A lot of the functionality of certain packages and files are done and set up by 'going through the motion'
So understanding fully is not likely. But by practicing multiple times, certain 'patterns' emerge and I can understand the logic.
Unfortunately I am not able to code everything from scratch without guides for now.

I also forgot how to css and bootstrap so I left the designing part out entirely.

●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Nothing.
